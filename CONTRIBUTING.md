Thank you for considering to contribute to this repository. Please make sure to read and understand this documentation to ease up your contribution process.

This repository is open sourced, and is open to new contributions of all types. You may open new issues, pull requests, or even work on that which are already open.

## Contributing to the Repository

To be able to contribute to this repository, be sure to fork this repository from the fork option at the top-right of this repository, if not yet done. Your forked repository is from where you'll initiate (and later update, if needed) your pull requests from. 

Go to the forked repository to add and update files for improvisation. 
Now, you can do this either directly from [GitHub Website](https://github.com), or by using [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) ([Command Line Interface](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git)).

After you clone the repository, please read and understand what the existing code or document is meant for, before overwriting it with your changes. If you're unsure about any part, feel free to ask it in discussions, and we'd be happy to help.

Here's a summary of essential steps when using [CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git), just to keep you in flow, and to ensure that you don't miss on any of the necessary steps:
1. `git pull <Your_Forked_Repo_URL_Here>`
2. Check files, and make your updations
3. `git add .` (This adds all the files for commiting)
4. `git commit -m "<Your One-Liner Commit Message>"`
5. `git pull`
6. `git push`

After following these steps in CLI, you'll need to go to your github repository in the website.

### Contributor's Hack, 2020

This repository has also been accepting contributions under Contributor's Hack 2020 by [HakinCodes](https://github.com/HakinCodes). 
If you'd like to get accounted for contributions under this program, then the contribution process is almost same as the above, and you'll just additionally need to ensure:
1. Your PR (Pull Request) made must be linked to an issue, that **must** contain the `CH20` as a label. (This can be simply done by mentioning the issue number with a pound or hash (specifically `#`) symbol preceeding the issue number).
