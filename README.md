In the recent times, GitHub has evolved from more than being a place to keep a record of all your amazing projects üíª with their respective source-code. It is now a proof of your commitment, urge to solve problems, not just in the DSA questions in the interviews, but those which you notice around, and come up with software/hardware solutions. Having an amazing GitHub profile ü§© is one of the aims of every developer today. 

This application helps you to work on it. In this application, you can analyze your GitHub profile with a GitHub grade, compare your profile with some amazing people out there, and also your fellow developer friends and get a ready-made resume on the basis of your GitHub profile.
